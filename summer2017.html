I decided that it was necessary for me to advance my knowledge of Git. To reach my goal, I printed off a Git cheat sheet and had it on my desk at all times for quick reference. I also watched a few videos on the basics of working with git with multiple people, since this one the fundamental difference compared to school. Another step to reaching my goal was when I did ask for help I wrote down the steps that were taken, for later reference. By the end of my work term, I rarely was asking for help with Git and felt confident in my abilities.</td>

With every pull request, you must have commit messages for each commit and pull request documentation. I found at the beginning of my work term I was very vague with my descriptions and commit messages that many people that were reviewing my code have to ask questions about my reasoning and methods.  As the work term went on, I looked at how other did their documentation and took notes on what they pointed out in their code. This observing helps me understand where I need to document for myself. I also asked coworkers to suggest where I could improve in my documentation. By the end of the work term, I was rarely getting questions about my pull requests.</td>

I found my self, in the beginning, saying one-word updates for stand up while everyone else at least was saying a few sentences describing what they are doing. I started to write down point form notes during the day when I started a new task; this helped when getting to stand up the next morning that I had it all in front of me and more people could engage with what I was doing.  After starting this method of writing things down, I found that I was making fewer assumptions about the task I was working on because my stand up would spark conversations with other developers and a lot of question would get answered. </td>

                <h5 align="left">Project: The Hub</h5>
                <p align="left">The main project at Post Media I/O is the HUB, is used to show post media clients how the solutions for advertising from Post Media are impacting their company. Customers buy solutions such as Search Engine Optimization, Landing Pages, Responsive Web Sites, etc. These solutions are built out by Postmedia, and the Hub calculates results for the solutions, such as how many clicks from SEO lead to a conversion (i.e., someone buying a product from the client). The Hub is a web application that has many graphs and tables to outline easily to the customer all the data they want to know.  </p>

                <p align="left"> 
                      My Role in the Hub was to be a front end developer; I started with many UI/UX fixes to get an understanding of the code base. The front end was all done using react and redux which I never used before, therefore there was a bit more of a learning curve than just learning the code base. Once my understanding of the code base and react and redux grew I took on more complicated tasks that involved a bit more interaction with the backend.  For these tasks learning some MongoDB and type script and the use of some new application such and robot mongo and JSON formatted were necessary to make life easier with debugging and planning.
                </p>
                <h5 align="left">Project: NIE</h5>  
                <p align="left">    
                   News papers in Education(NIE) is a program that runs with most paper product newspapers in Canada. The program is that when someone wants to pause their paper from being delivered because they are going on vacation, they can pause it or donate it to students to either have an online e-paper subscription or paper product. The NIE project was to replace the existing program that post media uses to take in the donations and separate to the schools that have signed up for the NIE Program, also taking care of how the school gets access to the e-paper subscription.
