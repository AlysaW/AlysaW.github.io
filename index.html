This made this goal a priority for me to work on for my own success at the CCS as well as down the road when needing to do any documentation on any later projects. The steps I took to improve my communication skills in tickets was to take down point form notes while on a calls about the issue the client is having also keeping track of all the things that were troubleshooted over the phone. Once the call is finished add as much extra detail to those notes as possible, creating a very comprehensive description of the problem. I would also have colleague look over emails at times when the content could be possible to technical for the client to understand, my colleague would help with the wording when possible. This gave me a better understanding on how to do write something similar on a future ticket.By the end of my work term I noticed that there was less ticket of mine that other teams would have to ask question about, as well as less back and forth with clients.</td>
                            <td bgcolor="#A49F9E"><h3>Finish Tickets Faster</h3>When things get busy and there was back to back calls, tickets that need to be completed build up and it is possible to start to forget or have issues mixed together. The faster I was able to get  ticket completed before getting another call was key to having properly completed descriptions in tickets. My goal to avid a pile of tickets at the end of a flurry of calls was to have the ticket finished before the 1 minute timer between calls ends. To Complete this goal the steps that I took were to open a ticket when the call starts, take notes already in the ticket not on the notebook (pen and paper style). As well as use as many online sources and Knowledge base documents as possible while working with the client on the phone.  By the end of the work term I was finishing most tickets before the time, if I new  a ticket needed more time I would work on the ticket while on the phone with the next client while the client was testing out a troubleshooting task, therefor at that time I would be working on 2 tickets. This task greatly improved my multitasking / time management skills.</td>

At CCS there is a lot of documentation on common issue that we have, one of my steps was to read through the knowledgebase documents to gather as much information on breaks as possible. As well as asking colleagues on any interesting/complicated things that they encounter at the IT Desk and how they solved the issue. By the end of my work term I felt more comfortable with common wifi issue and tackling new problems by using more resources that are available in documentation. </td>

I volunteered on doing website editing, and was able to have access to see site that were in the making for CCS. This help me gain knowledge about the specification that were used at the University. All the websites affiliated with the university are on the same template/ format therefore there is uniformity for the user.  As well as they are ADOA compliant meaning that the website is accessible for any person with a disability. Things that had to be put in to places for this standard was that any picture that was on the website had to have text describing the picture when hovering over. Therefor when someone is using a screen reading they can still understand the webpage. </td>

Therefor this was the perfect time to work on leadership skill well helping out the returning part times.  Steps to improving my leadership skills, was to provide documentation  to provide quick knowledge on the application and processes that have changed. Also provide detailed on the workarounds to issues, with doing this make sure to know just do the job / give the answer show it is not and why it was caused. I have noticed that my leadership skill have improved since working here, the result were that I was able to successfully help part time staff more effective with them learning how to do it for the next time they encounter the problem/ issue. </td>

                <p>An overview of what I did at CCS:  I worked in the CCS Help Centre and CCS IT Desk, at both places I provided Front line IT Support on the university webpages, application, accounts. We would receive calls emails and in person drop ins. With every issue that we would solve we would create a ticket in FootPrints (it is a email ticketed system). This email ticketed system helped us communicate between teams in ccs and clients.  Something that took a while to get the hang of  was how to describe technical details to clients over email, that could be easily understood by any user.

                    There were many times during my experience as an IT Specialist at ccs that my Problem solving and time management skills were put to the test while obscure issue would always be rolling in to the email queue or in person to the helpdesk.  As well there are times while you have back to back calls and tickets that need to be filled out and emails in the queue that need to be answer, I started to get very good and multitasking by the end of my work term report.Most of the technical support knowledge learned on the job from other employees and trial and error. While the skills to slove the issues were learned from school independent assignments were problem solving is imperative to the completion and success on the assignment.

                    Through 8 month working for CCS there were a few changed to the university that the CCS Supported. At the end of July there was an email migration for Staff / Faculty and Graduate Students from Zimbra to office 365. As Front line support we were very busy in the first few month of using the new email system. As there were many thing for the clients learn and understand about Office 365, and there were also a few glitches that happened were thing need to resolved by the Office 365 team in CCS.  I learned a lot from this experience, Its hard to roll out something very different to user that are use to a certain layout and features. This helps me in how I look at when designing a GUI or special features in any of my software programs for school,  that you want something new and fresh but not something too different that could cause confusion for the end user.
