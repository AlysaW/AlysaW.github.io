The stronger your communication skill with technical details are the great success when solving issues faster and easier for clients. My goal of developing my communication skills was a  priority for me to work on for my success at the CCS as well as down the road when needing to do any documentation on any following projects. The steps I took to improve my communication skills in tickets was to take down point form notes while on a call about the issue the client is having also keeping track of all the things that were tested/tried over the phone. Once the call is complete, add as much extra detail to those notes as possible, creating a very comprehensive description of the problem. I would also have a colleague look over emails at times when the content could be possibly to technical for the client to understand, my colleague would help with the wording when possible. This verification gave me a better understanding of how to write something similar on a future ticket. By the end of my work term, I noticed that there were fewer tickets of mine that other teams would have to ask questions about, as well as less back and forth with clients.</td>
                            <td bgcolor="#A49F9E"><h3>Finish Tickets Faster</h3>When things get busy, and there was back to back calls, tickets that are incomplete build up and it is possible to start to forget or have issues mixed up. The faster I was able to get tickets completed before getting another call was critical to having completed descriptions correctly. My goal to avoid a pile up of tickets at the end of a flurry of calls was to have the ticket finished before the 1-minute timer between calls ends. To complete this goal the steps that I took were to open a ticket when the call starts, take notes already in the ticket not on the notebook (pen and paper style). I also used many online sources and knowledge-based documents as possible while working with the client on the phone.  At the end of my work term, I was finishing most tickets before the timer.  When a ticket needed more time, I would work on the incomplete ticket while on the phone with the next client.  This task significantly improved my multitasking/time management skills.</td>

At CCS there is a lot of documentation on the standard issue that we have, one of my steps was to read through the knowledge base documents to gather as much information on breaks as possible. As well as asking colleagues on any interesting/complicated things that they encounter at the IT Desk and how they solved the issue. By the end of my work term, I felt more comfortable with standard wifi issue and tackling new problems by using more resources that are available in the documentation. </td>
                            <td bgcolor="#A49F9E"><h3>Learn more about web development for a business, where standard and specification have to be met </h3>Learning more about the standards and specification of business websites was an interest of mine when working at CCS. I volunteered on doing website editing and was able to have access to see the sites that are in the making for CCS. This help me gain knowledge about the specification used at the University. All the websites affiliated with the university are on the same template/ format. Therefore, there is uniformity for the user.  The University web pages are AODA compliant meaning that the website is accessible to any person with a disability. The standards that are in place is that any picture that was on the website had to have text describing the image when hovering over an image.  Therefore, when someone is using a screen reader they can still understand the content on the web page. </td>

Therefore this was the perfect time to work on leadership skill while helping out the returning part times.  Steps to improving my leadership skills were to make documentation to provide quick knowledge on the application and processes that have changed, provide detailed on the workarounds to common issues. I have noticed that my leadership skill has improved since working here, the result was that I was able to successfully help part-time staff more efficient with learning how to do it for the next time they encounter the problem/ issue. </td>

                <p>An overview of what I did at CCS: I worked in the CCS Help Centre and CCS IT Desk, at both places I provided frontline IT Support. CCS provides support on the University web application such as Webadavisor, Courselink , and Gryph mail that students and faculty members use daily, as well as assist with software downloads from the software distribution site and accounts. We would receive calls emails and in person drop-ins. With every issue that we would solve, we would create a ticket in FootPrints (it is an email ticketed system). This email ticketed system helped us communicate between teams in CCS and clients. Something that took a while to get the hang of was how to describe technical details to clients over email.

                      There were many times during my experience as an IT Specialist at CCS that my problem solving and time management skills were put to the test while complex issue would always be rolling into the email queue or in person to the helpdesk. As well there are times while you have back to back calls and tickets that need to be filled out and emails in the queue that need answering, I started to get excellent at multitasking by the end of my work term. Most of the technical support knowledge learned on the job was from other employees and by trial and error. While the skills to resolve issues were learned from school independent assignments where problem solving is imperative to completing a successful assignment.

                    Through 8 months working for CCS, there were a few changes to the University that the CCS supported. At the end of July, there was an email migration for Staff / Faculty and Graduate Students from Zimbra to Office 365. As frontline support, we were very busy in the first few month of using the new email system. There were many things for the clients to learn and understand about Office 365, and there were also a few glitches that happened that need to resolved by the Office 365 team in CCS. I learned a lot from this experience; It's hard to roll out something very different to users that are used to a certain layout and features. This challenge helped me in how I look at designing a GUI or special features in any of my software programs for school. You want something new and fresh but not something too different that could cause confusion for the end user.
