                <h2>Job Description</h2>

                <p>An overview of what I did at CCS:  I worked in the CCS Help Centre and CCS IT Desk, at both places I provided Front line IT Support on the university webpages, application, accounts. We would receive calls emails and in person drop ins. With every issue that we would solve we would create a ticket in FootPrints (it is a email ticketed system). This email ticketed system helped us communicate between teams in ccs and clients.  Something that took a while to get the hang of  was how to describe technical details to clients over email, that could be easily understood by any user.   
                </p>
                
                <table>
                  <tr>
                  <img src="img/footprints.PNG" alt="FootPrints" style="width:100%">
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <p>This is a screenshot of a footprints ticket template that was used daily at CCS.<p>

                </table>  

                <p> 
                    There were many times during my experience as an IT Specialist at ccs that my Problem solving and time management skills were put to the test while obscure issue would always be rolling in to the email queue or in person to the helpdesk.  As well there are times while you have back to back calls and tickets that need to be filled out and emails in the queue that need to be answer, I started to get very good and multitasking by the end of my work term report.Most of the technical support knowledge learned on the job from other employees and trial and error. While the skills to slove the issues were learned from school independent assignments were problem solving is imperative to the completion and success on the assignment.

                    Through 8 month working for CCS there were a few changed to the university that the CCS Supported. At the end of July there was an email migration for Staff / Faculty and Graduate Students from Zimbra to office 365. As Front line support we were very busy in the first few month of using the new email system. As there were many thing for the clients learn and understand about Office 365, and there were also a few glitches that happened were thing need to resolved by the Office 365 team in CCS.  I learned a lot from this experience, Its hard to roll out something very different to user that are use to a certain layout and features. This helps me in how I look at when designing a GUI or special features in any of my software programs for school,  that you want something new and fresh but not something too different that could cause confusion for the end user.
