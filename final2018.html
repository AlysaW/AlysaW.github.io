                                The municipal innovation Lab became a very intriguing aspect to the community, and many people want to know what we were
                                developing and testing. Therefore there were many impromptu demos in front of groups that
                                would come to visit. Impromptu demos were a big thing to get used to, as well a fantastic
                                opportunity to build communication skills. I worked with my co-worker to be prepared with
                                critical aspects to point out about the product and organize the order of points. This preparation
                                helped people understand the product better. By the end of the work term, I felt comfortable
                                doing a presentation on the product that we were building and that audience would understand
                                it.

                                Collaborating on any code based project git is a huge part of the day to day work. At the start of the work term, I was at
                                an intermediate level. To advance my git skills I took as my git issues that would come up
                                within our team. Taking on as many git issues as possible made me research and learn how
                                to solve more problems. Each time adding to my git documentation for later use if need. By
                                the end, I felt confident in my git abilities, but I could not say that I’m at an advanced
                                level just yet.

                                <h3>Advance my backend development skills</h3>

                                In a team of two developers, each took on a role in the development process. My role was to manage backend code development
                                and to take on a majority of backend tasks. Being a lead backend developer I wanted to make
                                sure to make the best decisions that would lead to a good foundation for the product. Therefore,
                                I made sure research architecture patterns when developing a new concept for the backend.
                                The research helped with code reuse and less refactoring later on. What I learned by the
                                end is no matter how much planning you do, there is always refactoring, and due to new understandings
                                that come in to play primarily in the environment of a pilot project lab, we're trying and
                                experimenting with new things is in the mandate.

                                The project was developed by just two coops and was going to be passed off to the co-ops after us. We had to document everything
                                so that they could continue with the project without asking us to come back and help describe
                                how something works. We started documentation from day one with documentation Fridays. I
                                would outline the big concept that I implemented that week with the reason why I did it a
                                certain way, then describe how it worked and provided any diagrams that were necessary to
                                explain the concepts better. I found if I jotted down notes throughout the week it help with
                                creating better-detailed documentation.

                                The small team environment became tough to solve problems that were outside of our familiarity. I realized quickly in my
                                work term that I would need to utilize the Communitch ecosystem as a resource for problem-solving
                                some issues with the project. Networking has never been my strong suit, so this was an excellent
                                opportunity to improve this skill. I made sure to talk with another lab over lunch, and share
                                ideas on issues that arose with the project also reached out for testing purpose. By the
                                end of the work term, I felt comfortable talking with other labs that even at one point I
                                collaborated with another lab to merge code bases to make our product one step better. </td>

                <p align="left">We are one of the new additions that have come with our participation in the smart city initiative. Our lab’s
                    goal is to provide insights on how to make the city more efficient to make Kitchener a smart city. Our
                    main project is creating a municipal machine learning and analytics platform called Clara. Clara is a
                    cat that lives in the clock tower in Victoria Park, and she roams the city looking for insights in making
                    the city more live, work, and playable. When askclara.ca gets launched you will be able to log on and
                    view visualized data using open data, third party data (i.e., Open Weather Map and Waze), and sensor
                    data (provided from the lights and other sensors from around the city) called Insight Tiles. They will
                    consist mainly of graphs, which will be comparing many sets of data, description, to give you an idea
                    of what the chart is all about. In the future, we hope to use machine learning to generate more insights
                    based on the current trends. You will also be able to groups insight tiles into sets we call dashboards.
                    With these collections of data, we hope to help you find new insights that will help the city in ways
                    you’ve never considered before. We will also provide you with a suggestion form to curate ideas and find
                    new ways to benefit the city.

                    The most interesting aspect of my work term was developing a project from scratch in such a small team. The small team allowed
                    me to wear many different hats then I wouldn't usually get the opportunity to in other co-op terms. I
                    was a project manager, project designer, UX designer, frontend and backend developer. With the opportunity
                    to do so many different roles I was able to learn many things that do not get touched on in my computer
                    science classes. An example of new things I got to learn is how to think of a product from ground one
                    and describe technical aspect to someone that does not have a technical background. Many of my communication
                    Skills were learned on the job, through trial and error as well as my backend server skills with setting
                    up AWS component for the project.

                        In conclusion, I have gained many useful technical and non-technical skills for my future in school and future work placements.
                        I have gained confidence and problem-solving skills in working independently and in a small team
                        environment. I have learned there is a lot of working parts in developing a project from scratch.
